# Interstellar

The player's spaceship moves left and right with the left and right keys and shoots with the space key.

In this game, the player must shoot the enemy spaceship before it reaches the bottom of the game window. At first, the player has three hearts, and for each enemy spaceship geting out the game board, one player's heart will be removed.

Game over modes:
1. Run out of player hearts.
2. The player's spaceship crashes with the enemy's spaceship.
